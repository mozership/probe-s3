# probe-s3

A [Probe](https://github.com/mozership/probe) action that reads and writes objects in S3 and in storage that speaks its protocol, such as MinIO, Cloudflare R2 or Versity Gateway.

Probe downloads it the first time a workflow uses it. It needs Probe v1.21.0 or later, which reads the guard and the params the action declares in `action.yml`.

```yaml
name: Upload
actions:
  s3: github.com/mozership/probe-s3@<commit SHA>
jobs:
- name: upload
  steps:
  - name: Upload an avatar through the API
    id: upload
    uses: http
    with:
      url: https://api.example.com
      post: /avatars
      multipart:
        image:
          file: ./fixtures/logo.png
    test: res.code == 201
    outputs:
      key: res.body.key

  - name: The object is in the bucket, as it was sent
    uses: s3
    with:
      bucket: example-avatars
      region: ap-northeast-1
      head: "{{outputs.upload.key}}"
    test: res.code == 200 && res.content_type == "image/png" && res.metadata.owner == "42"
```

The workflow gives the action a name once, under `actions`, and its steps use the name. Probe only takes a full 40-character commit SHA there. The notes of each [release](https://github.com/mozership/probe-s3/releases) start with the action and its commit to copy.

`actions` needs Probe v1.24.0 or later. With an earlier one, write the action in full in each `uses`, as `uses: github.com/mozership/probe-s3@<commit SHA>`.

A step does one operation on one bucket. It cannot make or remove a bucket.

## Parameters

A step names its operation by one of these keys, and has exactly one of them.

| Key | Value | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `get` | The key of an object | Reads the object: its content, its digest and what its headers tell |
| `head` | The key of an object | Reads what the headers tell of the object, without its content |
| `list` | A prefix, or nothing | Lists the objects whose keys start with the prefix, or every object |
| `put` | The key of an object | Writes the object, from `body` or from `file` |
| `delete` | The key of an object | Deletes the object |

The others say where the bucket is and how to sign the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bucket` | String | Yes | - | The bucket |
| `region` | String | No | `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, or `us-east-1` | The region the request is signed for, and on AWS the one it is sent to |
| `endpoint` | String | No | AWS | Where S3-compatible storage is served, as `http://localhost:9000` or `https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` |
| `path_style` | Boolean | No | See below | Addresses the bucket in the path, as `<endpoint>/<bucket>/<key>`, rather than in the host, as `<bucket>.<endpoint>/<key>` |
| `access_key_id` | String | No | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | The access key |
| `secret_access_key` | String | No | `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | The secret access key |
| `session_token` | String | No | `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` | The session token of temporary credentials |
| `body` | String, or any other value | For `put`, unless `file` | - | What a `put` writes: a string as it is, anything else as JSON, with the content type `application/json` unless `content_type` says otherwise |
| `file` | String | For `put`, unless `body` | - | Path to the file a `put` writes, relative to the working directory |
| `content_type` | String | No | - | The media type a `put` stores with the object |
| `metadata` | Object | No | - | The metadata a `put` stores with the object, sent as `x-amz-meta-<name>`. Names are lowercased, and values must be printable ASCII |
| `max_keys` | Integer | No | The storage's, `1000` on S3 | The most objects a `list` returns |
| `timeout` | Duration | No | `30s` | Time limit for the whole step, as `10s` or a number of seconds. `0` removes it |

A key of `with` that is not one of these fails the step before anything is sent, and `probe check` reports it with its line. A parameter given to an operation that does not take it, such as `body` with `get`, fails the step the same way.

`path_style` defaults to `true` with an `endpoint`, as MinIO and the like are served under one name, and to `false` on AWS, except for a bucket with a dot in its name, which the certificate of `*.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com` does not cover.

### Credentials

When `with` has none of `access_key_id`, `secret_access_key` and `session_token`, the action reads `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` from the environment Probe runs in. Without credentials in either place, the request is sent unsigned, as a public bucket takes it. The action reads no profile, no instance metadata and no other source of credentials, so it connects to nothing but the storage.

Leave the credentials to the environment where you can. A secret access key written in `with` is not shown in the result, in a report or in the action's own log, but `probe --verbose` prints the parameters each action is called with, and it hides only the values Probe knows to be credentials. Declare the variable under [`secrets`](https://probe.linyo.ws/reference/yaml-configuration#secrets) when you pass one through `with`:

```yaml
vars:
  storage_secret: "{{STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}"
secrets:
  - STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

## Result

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `res.code` | Integer | HTTP status code, such as `200`, or `204` for a `delete` |
| `res.status` | String | HTTP status line, such as `"200 OK"` |
| `res.headers` | Object | Response headers, keyed by canonical name such as `Content-Type` |
| `res.error_code` | String | The error the storage answered with, such as `NoSuchKey`, `NoSuchBucket`, `AccessDenied` or `SignatureDoesNotMatch`, or empty. A `head` has no body to carry it, so it is empty for one |
| `res.error_message` | String | What the storage said of the error, or empty |
| `req` | Object | What was done: `operation`, `bucket`, `region`, `endpoint`, `path_style`, the `url` the answer came from, and `signed`, with the `key` of the object, or the `prefix` and `max_keys` of a list. A `put` also has `body`, `file`, `content_type`, `metadata`, and the `size` and `sha256` of what it sent. It never has the credentials |
| `rt` | Duration | Time the step took |
| `status` | Integer | `0` when the status code is 2xx; `1` otherwise |

A `get` and a `head` add what the headers tell of the object.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `res.etag` | String | The ETag, without its quotes |
| `res.size` | Integer | Size in bytes |
| `res.content_type` | String | The media type stored with the object |
| `res.last_modified` | String | When it was last written, as `2026-10-10T01:02:03Z` |
| `res.metadata` | Object | The metadata stored with the object, by lowercased name, without `x-amz-meta-` |

A `get` adds the content.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `res.body` | Any | The content as text. Parsed into an object or array when `res.content_type` says JSON and it is JSON. Empty for a binary object |
| `res.rawbody` | String | The unparsed content, present when it was parsed as JSON |
| `res.sha256` | String | SHA-256 digest of the whole object, in hex |
| `res.truncated` | Boolean | Whether the object is larger than 1 MiB, of which `res.body` holds the first |
| `res.binary` | Boolean | Whether the content is not UTF-8 text, and so not in `res.body` |

`res.sha256` and `res.size` are of the whole object however large it is, so a binary or large object is checked by them, against the `req.sha256` of the step that wrote it or a digest you know.

A `put` adds `res.etag`. A `list` adds these.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `res.objects` | Array | The objects, in the order of their keys, each with `key`, `size`, `etag` and `last_modified` |
| `res.count` | Integer | How many objects `res.objects` has |
| `res.truncated` | Boolean | Whether the storage has more objects than it returned |

Once the storage answers, what it answered is a result, so a test can assert on a `404` for a key that should be gone or a `403` for a bucket that should be closed. Only a request that gets no answer, such as a refused connection or a timeout, fails the step as an error.

## Examples

Against AWS, with the credentials of the environment:

```yaml
- name: The export is there and not empty
  uses: s3
  with:
    bucket: example-exports
    region: ap-northeast-1
    list: "daily/{{vars.today}}/"
  test: "res.code == 200 && res.count > 0 && all(res.objects, #.size > 0)"
```

Against MinIO, writing a fixture and reading it back. The job's `defaults`, keyed by the name the workflow gave the action, keep the endpoint, the bucket and the credentials out of each step:

```yaml
- name: fixtures
  defaults:
    s3:
      endpoint: http://localhost:9000
      bucket: fixtures
      access_key_id: "{{vars.minio_user}}"
      secret_access_key: "{{vars.minio_password}}"
  steps:
  - name: Put a fixture
    id: put
    uses: s3
    with:
      put: config/app.json
      body:
        enabled: true
    test: res.code == 200
    outputs:
      sha256: req.sha256

  - name: Get it
    uses: s3
    with:
      get: config/app.json
    test: res.body.enabled == true && res.sha256 == outputs.put.sha256

  - name: A key that must not be there
    uses: s3
    with:
      head: config/removed.json
    test: res.code == 404
```

## Redirects

On AWS, a bucket that is not in the region the request was signed for is read from the region AWS names in its answer. A `Location` the storage answers with is followed too, up to 5 times, when it stays within the storage: under `amazonaws.com`, or the host of `endpoint` and the names under it. Each request is signed again for where it goes. A redirect to anywhere else is not followed, and is the result.

## Guard

The action keeps to the guard of the run, and its `action.yml` declares `guard: [read-only, allow-host]`, so Probe runs it under `--read-only` and `--allow-host` without `--allow-action`.

- Under `--read-only`, only `get`, `head` and `list` are run. A `put` or a `delete` is refused before anything is sent, and before `file` is read.
- Under `--allow-host`, every host a request goes to must be one the run allows: the host the bucket is addressed at, which on AWS is `<bucket>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com`, or `s3.<region>.amazonaws.com` with `path_style`, and the host of each redirect. A URL without a port is taken at the port of its scheme: `80` for `http` and `443` for `https`. `--allow-host '*.amazonaws.com'` allows a bucket in whichever region it is.

A refused step fails with the kind `refused`.

## Releasing

Pushing a `v*` tag builds the executables with GoReleaser and publishes them on the release. The workflow then has `probe manifest` write an `action.yml` with their URLs and SHA-256 digests, commits it to `main`, and adds the commit to the release notes. The name, the description, `guard` and `params` are those of the `action.yml` at the tag, so that file is where to change them. That commit is the one to pin: Probe reads `action.yml` at the pinned commit and refuses an executable whose digest differs.
